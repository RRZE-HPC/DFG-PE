# Exchange platform for projects from DFG Call on "Performance Engineering für wissenschaftliche Software"

This Repository is intended to serve as an collaboration portal for all
projects of the DFG Call  on "Performance Engineering für
wissenschaftliche Software" and any institution that is interested in
cluster-wide job-specific performance monitoring.

Contact thomas.gruber@fau.de or jan.eitzinger@fau.de if you want to be added to this repository.

Some guidelines:

* Communication and discussion is by means of issue tickets.
* You can create projects. Every project has a table kind of overview of
the status of issue tickets. You can label tickets according to their
nature and assign them to a project. Issue tickets can then be moved
around on the project table. In order to make progress someone needs to
grab the ticket and do the work :-).
* The wiki can be used for documentation

At the moment there is one project:

* Whitepaper on Job specific performance monitoring: https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/DFG-PE/projects/1

Although this README is written in English, the language is not fixed. See [#4](/../../issues/4).
